I just made this app as an experiment to try Electron.net and learn some modern JavaScript and .Net Core.

The idea of this project is to create my own file explorer since I don't like Mac OSX Finder very much :man_shrugging:.

This app can be run as a regular MVC.

It can also be built into an Electron app by following these steps: https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET#start-the-application
